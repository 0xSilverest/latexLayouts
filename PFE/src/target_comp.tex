As it shows there are additional databases mainly ones for archiving files as is the case of
S3 and also archiving data for statistics down the line thus using DynamoDB\@.
Also containerizing the backend for the goal of having it run different instances
seamlessly, spawn the run times duplicate efficiently to have better load handling
and manage usage spikes.
For the creation of the images, it should be noted that they will be generated
automatically, aswell as their deployment.
Finally comes adding new features to the backend, and refactoring the majority of the code
to make it more readable, maintanable and optimized.

First and foremost, I am extremely grateful for my parents for their love, prayers and
sacrifices from the time I've been a child to till now, and for their support and
encouragement with my studies and career choices. I am also grateful for my brother 
who has been a source of inspiration and support to me in my life. And my sister
who has always been a great support in my life.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my organization supervisor Mr. Darraz
Othman, who guided me in the development of the project and provided me with the necessary support to complete the tasks I was assigned. And especially for giving me the chance of
joining such an ambitious and dynamic project where I learned a lot of new things.

My sincere thanks go to my academic supervisor M. Besri Zineb, who guided me through the
release of this report and put down me on the right path. Also I'm thankful for her
patience, support, encouragement and for all the time she gave us to complete our work
in the right way.

I would also like to thank the CEO of the company I worked for, Mr. Jean-Marie Lespiaucq,
for giving me the opportunity to work with such a great project, and for his encouraging 
and enthusiastic support. And for giving me the chance to play a part in the development
of the project not just as a student but as a professional.

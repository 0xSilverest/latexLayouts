The reliance on automated and self-sustaining systems is increasing especially
in the fields of logistics, finance, and manufacturing. But there are still many
manual processes that need to be addressed for management aspect. This is where
automation steps in where every repeatable human process can be dropped into an
automated workflow.

The company I'll be partaking in this internship is "ONAR MMSoft" which is a company
specialized in developing workflow management services for three core activities,
which are catering, logisitics and industry. For my subject, we'll be focusing mainly
on the logistics aspect, where they already offer a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
for the management of fleets flow within factories.

So during this internship, I undertook the subject of industrializing a Minimum
Viable Product (MVP) for a logistics company, which presents the challenge of
turning a usable Proof of Concept (PoC) into a rigid, reliable and scalable Software
as a Service (SaaS), and to handle this process in a structured way, we'll be following
the kanban method.

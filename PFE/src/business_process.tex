So for the business process, as stated previously, we have a set of activities that organizes the trucks and their drivers.
In the goal of have their workflow optimized.

And it goes as follows:

To give more context to the diagram above, we will dive into the details of it processes.

So first of all we have the following core processes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Kiosk for drivers access to the warehouses and factories
    \item Digitalization of documents
    \item Secure access to logistics platform
    \item Dashboard for the management
\end{itemize}

Starting by welcoming the driver, this process relies on the driver to introduce himself, his credentials,
scan any documents related to the transportation and also have a signature of the driver for the legal purposes
all that present at a kiosk, once all that data has been input the driver is invited to wait at the truck awaiting
the response from the management.

Then there is the digitalization of the documents which is the process of the driver to have a digital copy
of the documents that are all sent to the management dashboard for verification and approval, to give sign
to the driver that the documents are correct and that he can proceed to the next step, sending the approval
is done through sending a notification either through the phone application, an sms or calling by pager.

Next comes the secure access to the logistics platform, this process is mainly related to infrastructure gate,
the driver has a special access code to the platform, this code is generated by the management and is sent to
the driver by sms or through the application, once the driver accesses the platform the management is notified
by his arrival.

Finally, the dashboard for the management is the main interface for the management and it's divided into multiple
workspaces depending on the role and priveleges of the user depending on the needs of the clients.

And to tackle this business process came the creation of a complex system that offers 
multiple functionalities to the management, real-time monitoring of the trucks,
the management can see the status of the trucks, the status of the drivers,
the status of the documents, a notification system that interacts with multiple devices,
a guiding system for the drivers, \dots
And all of this requires specific orchestration and automation of the processes.

So with the worflow management problem in hand, and the company's expertise in building
system oriented to thise kind of problems, it has built a solution  which is an MVP
called "Easy Truck in" that takes in charge the management of the trucks workflow
and the logistics of the deliveries. Giving multiple features and options but the 
solution is just a MVP and not a full-fledged product. So the main goal of this project
is to adapt the MVP to industrial norms, making it more rigid and scalable.

This already existing solution comes with its own set of problems.

Beginning from the most obvious one we have at hand is the usage of different technologies in
the backend without any advantage in place for opting to this approach, such as NodeJs and Spring
Boot, which in the long term affects the maintainability of the solution, as reported by the CTO,
was developed by a freelancer and went untouched since. So rather than a maintainable solution,
they opted for a momentary solution to have a PoC.
While it's only handling the registration process, it would be better if it just migrated to the
same stack of the whole system. That will allow the reusability of code, as there are already
implementations for handling the Users Database on the Spring code base, and there is really
no purpose to separate the systems.

For the databases as of the current solution,
there are already two databases put in place a MySQL database to deal with any data that relates to users,
the other is a Redis database to deal with real-time data such as tracking truck entries etc.
Redis being the database to deal with real-time data, it needs a daily or
casual cleaning of the database to avoid having to deal with unnecessary data loaded in the real-time DB,
thus there will be no way to offer KPI and other statistical results, which are always a good selling point
to clients.

Furthermore, going through the existing code base, the secrets that are credentials are all exposed in the code,
in terms of industrialization, it means there's a lack of security.

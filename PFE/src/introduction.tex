At the growth rate multiple industries are going through, it's no secret that the reliance
on automated and self-sustaining systems is increasing especially in the fields of
logistics, finance, and manufacturing. Targeting more specifically the supply chain
logistics, the industry is looking for solutions that can automate decision making
processes of moving goods from one place to another, ones targetting efficiency increase
for warehousing and distribution networks, others diving into security aspects of the
supply chain, or even managing the flow of goods and services including a bunch of
processes for transformation of raw materials into marketable products within logistics
which is what we call \emph{SCM} or Supply Chain Management.

But even with all this automation in hand, there is still many time consuming and manual
processes that need to be addressed precisely for management aspect.

So here where automation steps in, every repeatable human process can be dropped into an
automated workflow that can be executed in a timely manner or triggered as a on demand
service. Providing a unified interface for all the processes, the automation can be used
to automate the entire supply chain.

Thus came in my decision to partake in the development of a product aimed for the
automation of the fleet management process within factories with "ONAR MMSoft".

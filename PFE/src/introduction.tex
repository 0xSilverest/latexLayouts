In the future, most if not all the services that rely on humans to organize and manage them will become automated,
and autonomous, and thus, the human resources will be no longer needed.
So, the need for a service or software that can automate the management of logistics is definitely a growing one.

So in the course of my engineering studies in ENSA of Tetouan, I have chosen to partake in the development of a
service that can automate and ease the management of logistics factories workflow, within the company ONAR MMCall
with a team of competent developpers, taking in charge everything that's related to backend and infrastructure of
the SaaS\@.

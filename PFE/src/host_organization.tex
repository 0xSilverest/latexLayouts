The organisation unit, I've integrated, is composed of three members,
the CTO "Othman Darraz" who's in charge of managing the project, reviewing new modules
and PR requests, a freelancer "Johan Maia" who's in charge of everything that's front-end
from web application to phone application, and me joining them as the third member of the
team to partake in the backend and infrastructure mainly refactoring, security and
improving the infrastructure from virtualisation to deployment.

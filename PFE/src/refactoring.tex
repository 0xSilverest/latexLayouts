\subsection {Adding user management system}

The old system didn't have a user management system, as it relied on the site being the
user so there wasn't really users to manage. So we had to integrate users within the system
then add a way to manage them, and this was done by migrating the site from being the user
to being an entity that could be managed by users who have the right to do so.
And that required rework through the majority of the backend as this architecture was
relied on by all the backend services and controller and also frontend.

So we had to change this architecture to be able to manage users and their roles, but also
keep the old behaviour the same.

%TODO: Add class diagram before and after (Couldn't do it now because we migrated directly without using diagrams)

\subsection {Implementation of tests for existing codebase}

TODO: Still not touched on yet

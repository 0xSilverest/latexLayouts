In this chapter we'll have a brief showcase of the project, and where the modules
I've been working on are located within.

Firstly we'll have a brief look at the East Truck In (ETI) interface, which is 
the main interface for the project. We'll specifically look into the user management
aspect.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/login too much attempts}
    \caption{Login requests stopped after too much attempts}
    \label{fig:login_req_ratelimit}
\end{figure}

In the figure \ref{fig:login_req_ratelimit} we can see that the login requests after a
certain number of attempts where the login was erroneous in purpose started getting
error 429, which is due to  the API rate limiter being triggered as we've discussed in
section \ref{subsec:ratelimiting}.

Next we'll take a look at the \ref{subsec:user_management} section, which is the
update of the user's profile, to make it easier to manage roles and have a overall easier
to use system.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{images/user management}\hfill
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{images/userLessRoles}
    \caption{ETI Main Page}
    \label{fig:user_management_view}
\end{figure}

So the main view of the user management interface is the one in the figure
\ref{fig:user_management_view} which is a list of all workspaces available to the current
user, in my case I have access to all five workspaces.

So by removing a couple of workspaces from the current user from the database,
we can see that the user management interface is also updated and the workspaces
access change and that's due to the user management module we've implemented.

So here in 2nd figure \ref{fig:user_management_view}, we removed three workspaces from
the current user and we have access to only two workspaces.

So this access control is only doable by two types of users, the ones with the roles
of \textit{admin} which is a superuser and users who have the access role of
\textit{Account Manager} which is a user who can manage the accounts of other users.
From creating a new user to deleting a user, and they are related to the site.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{images/insertingANewUser}
    \hfill
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{images/password}
    \caption{Adding a new user}
    \label{fig:insert_user}
\end{figure}

The figure \ref{fig:insert_user} shows the part in account management where we can add
a new user to the system. Giving power to control his roles and workspaces.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/accManager}
    \caption{Account Manager}
    \label{fig:accManager}
\end{figure}

Once added the user is shown in the list of users, on the side of the page. As shown in 
figure \ref{fig:accManager} where we can see all the users that are in the site the 
current user is in.

Once user added, we get the possibility to create a new password for the user. By clicking
the generate password button, then a email is sent to the user and then you receive the
email in your inbox that redirects you to a page in 2nd figure \ref{fig:insert_user} where
it can be seen that the client gets invited to introduce their password.
Such a mechanism is put in place because the users can only be created by account managers.

As for the rest of the workspaces their business logic is mostly for the fleet management, 
and wasn't in the scope of my implementation except for creating roles for those workspaces
to be accessible.
